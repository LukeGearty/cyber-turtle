    <p>30 Days of TryHackMe: Day 5
Welcome to 30 Days of TryHackMe, where I try to build a streak of learning through the website TryHackMe. Today I am picking up right where I left off on the Complete Beginner Path and tackle Cryptography.</p>

<p>The first room is Hashing — Crypto 101, a kind of introduction to the concept of cryptography. It goes over some definitions, and it goes over hashing. Hashing is taking an input of any size and creating a ‘digest’ of the input, of a fixed size. The output needs to be unique (even changing a little bit of the text should give out a new hash). A hash is, in theory, irreversible, but some hashes are more secure than others.</p>

<p>Passwords are stored in hashes, which is why they are useful to know about from a security perspective.</p>

<p>It then gives a few examples of how to find some hashes, some online and through other tools.</p>

<p>The next room is all about the password cracking tool John the Ripper. John the Ripper is a tool you can use in order to crack passwords, if you have the hash of the password. The room goes over a lot of the different ways to use John, and you will get a little bit of more experience with the tool through some challenges.</p>

<p>The final room of this section is Encryption — Crypto 101. This room is extremely theory heavy, and one of the first questions you ‘answer’ is to not complain about how theory heavy it is.</p>

<p>You are once again introduced to some definitions, but this room will go into the why of cryptography. Cryptography is essential for ensuring security in pretty much any context involving a computer. Doing this room also stresses the importance of the modulo operator (think something like 65 % 6) in cryptography.</p>

<p>This room also goes over the different kinds of encryption, keys and asymmetric cryptography, digital signatures, and a whole lot more. This is probably one of the more theory heavy rooms I’ve done so far, but it was good to learn a lot more about a topic I wasn’t too familiar with.</p>

<p>This section wasn’t too time consuming, but it did require a lot more thinking to be done than previous sections.</p>
