    <p>30 Days of TryHackMe: Day 1
Welcome to 30 Days of TryHackMe, where I try to complete a section in TryHackMe every single day for the next 30 days. The purpose of this is to build up a streak of learning, and also as a review of things that may have slipped my mind. This is Day 1, so I am starting right at the beginning and I am going to work my way through.</p>

<p>The path I selected is the Complete Beginner Pathway. I have used TryHackMe before, but I want to get the complete experience of someone coming to this website with no experience.</p>

<p>The first section in this pathway is the Complete Beginner Introduction. The first section, aptly called Tutorial, goes over how to use the AttackBox, which is the machine a user would use while learning. You start up the machine, wait a few minutes for it to load, and then follow a simple set of instructions to get your first flag. A flag is a string of text that you get after completing cybersecurity challenges. Once you submit your flag, then you complete the room and move on to the next one.</p>

<p>All of the other rooms follow the same formula, although obviously some of the other rooms won’t be as easy as the first one.</p>

<p>After you finish Tutorial, the next room is Starting Out In Cyber Sec. This room goes over two different sides of cybersecurity: offensive and defensive. Both sides require an analytical mind, but there are some kety differences. Offensive security is all about attacking different applications and discovering where there are vulnerabilities. Defensive security is all about discovering and fixing those vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>After reading the description and answering some questions, you move on to the next room, Introductory Researching. The aim of this room is to encourage research into the field. Everyone in cybersecurity needs to research, no one knows everything.</p>

<p>Since the room required research, I aimed to do that for every question even if I knew the answers. It was kind of hard to do that with Google’s AI able to answer everything, so I had to improvise a little, to try to ask questions that someone who had just stumbled upon these subjects for the first time would ask.</p>

<p>I thought this was a pretty effective way of keeping me on my toes, because even for questions that I knew the answer to, understanding the why was an equally important concept. I thought this room did an excellent job emphasizing that.</p>

<p>Although in my research I did find people who just posted the questions to Quora or Reddit or some other website, and I do wonder if that is a form of cheating.</p>

<p>This room goes through general research questions and more specific vulnerability research, and using the Linux man command to figure out how to do specific things.</p>

<p>Overall this room was a great introduction to TryHackMe, and I had a lot of fun doing some research and learning a little bit more.</p>
