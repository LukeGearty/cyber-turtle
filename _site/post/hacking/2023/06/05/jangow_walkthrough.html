    <p>Can You Cheat While Hacking? Jangow Walkthrough
I want to get back into hacking. Jangow is a vulnerable machine rated as ‘easy’ on Vulnhub, so in order to get back into hacking I figured that a machine like that would be perfect.</p>

<p>In a Capture the Flag like this, there are two flags to get. The first flag is the user flag, and the second is when the hacker gets to the root user.</p>

<p>I first created a directory specifically for this machine. I wanted to make sure I put all the files in the same place, and document all my findings.</p>

<p>The next step in this CTF was to get the IP address and make sure it was on the same network as my Kali Linux machine. I know the IP address was in the log in screen, but I did want to do it in a more “official” way. I did this using a simple nmap scan of the network.</p>

<p>After I did that, I also saw that two ports were open. FTP on port 21 and HTTP on port 80. I then tried to see if I could log in to the FTP anonymously. Anonymous FTP logins use the username anonymous and any password, sometimes the anonymous user’s email as a way of documenting who is coming in and out.</p>

<p>That didn’t work, so my next step was to check out the HTTP website. I inspected the page source for any kind of comments in the HTML and JavaScript, but there was nothing there.</p>

<p>Bootstrap is a CSS framework, a way of easily formatting the appearance of a website.</p>

<p>I noticed there was a link on the website to a page called “buscar”. I remembered enough Spanish to recognize it as such, but didn’t remember enough to translate (sorry to all my Spanish teachers from fifth grade to high school).</p>

<p>This looked like this was a way of remote code execution, but I did want to gather a little bit more info.</p>

<p>To do that, I first used nmap -sV to get the service versions of the FTP and HTTP, to see if there were any vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>I then did a dirb scan of the website, although I will admit that I didn’t take a look at this afterwards.</p>

<p>My next move was to actually open up Burpsuite and intercept a request on that buscar page, to play around with it and test if my theory was correct. I opened up the browser in Burpsuite, intercepted a request, and sent it to the repeater.</p>

<p>My theory was correct. I executed whoami, and I got back ‘www-data’. I tested out a few more commands, and I used https://www.urlencoder.org/ to encode them.</p>

<p>I got the /etc/passwd file, and saw the user jangow01. I checked out the /home directory, and saw that this user had a directory. I looked inside, and I found the user.txt flag. Encoding the command to open up that user.txt, I got the first flag.</p>

<p>Important to know the version, and this comes to play later
Next step was to try to establish a more permanent presence. I first tried to do this by establish a reverse shell.</p>

<p>I have absolutely no idea why, but nothing I did worked. I first tried to do it through executing it through the URL, but that failed.</p>

<p>So I took a look around and found this config.php file in a wordpress directory.</p>

<p>Maybe those were the same credentials for the FTP?</p>

<p>I tried to log in, first with that username and password, but that failed. I then used jangow01, and managed to get in.</p>

<p>The next few steps were quite frustrating, because they were trying to establish a shell on the target machine, and each one failed.</p>

<p>I first made a bash script on my Kali machine, used the FTP credentials to put it in the /tmp directory of the target machine and confirmed that it was on the target machine.</p>

<p>Pro-Tip: Don’t name your reverse shell script ‘reverse_shell.sh’.
When I tried to execute that file, it still failed.</p>

<p>So at a loss, I decided to do one thing I didn’t really want to do when I started this, but it was quite necessary at this stage, because I had no idea why my efforts to establish a shell weren’t working.</p>

<p>I logged in through the actual machine. Is that cheating? I don’t know, but I did it anyway.</p>

<p>So having (technically) gotten access, I resolved to get to root. Through, researching the kernel version, I found this exploit for this kernel version. I downloaded it to my Kali machine first, compiled it on my kali machine, and used FTP to get it on the target machine.</p>

<p>I don’t think ‘normal_elf’ is a particularly good name for malicious binaries either
However, there were a few bumps in the road.</p>

<p>First, while on the Jangow machine, I couldn’t use the ‘/’ key. When executing a binary, you need to type ‘./binary_name’. So that was the first problem.</p>

<p>I managed to figure out a way around this, but to my chagrin I got the “version ‘glibc_2.34’ not found”. In this scenario, this just means I shouldn’t have compiled this binary on my Kali machine.</p>

<p>So I went through this again, except I just put the source code on the target machine and compiled it there.</p>

<p>But how did I get around not being able to use the ‘/’ key?</p>

<p>I compiled the source code, which the output was a file named ‘a.out’. I don’t know why, but I wasn’t able to name the output file. I had to figure out a way to get ‘./a.out’ into the command line. I used the find command, and outputted the results of that to a text file.</p>

<p>I then opened up the text file, and then used this ‘$(!!)’ to execute ‘./a.out’. This executed the a.out file, and I finally got to root.</p>
