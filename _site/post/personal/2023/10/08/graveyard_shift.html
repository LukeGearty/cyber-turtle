    <p>It was November of 2017. Eleven months after graduating from college, I was working in the job of nobody’s dreams: retail stock associate. Holiday season was fast approaching, and my manager at work approached me to ask a simple question.</p>

<p>“Are you available for overnights?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, absolutely,” I replied, with a sense of unease in my stomach.</p>

<p>I had just gotten into the stock team after weeks of being on the sales floor, and I was eager to stay there. I hated talking to people, and the crazy expectations of the sales floor were too stressful for me to handle. This was my first job out of college, and I was desperate to make a good impression. It won’t be permanent, I told myself.</p>

<p>And it was not permanent, but it was an experience I won’t forget. From late November of 2017 to April of 2018, I was working the graveyard shift at a retail job in a mall. Our job was to open boxes of shipment, put sensors on the merchandise in the boxes, and either place the new clothes on the sales floor or find room for it in the stockroom. The shift time was from 11 PM to 7 AM, sometimes going longer.</p>

<p>I remember being told it was going to be a temporary thing just for the holidays. If there’s one thing that anybody who has worked retail can attest to, it is that managers lie. The next five months of my life I became nocturnal.</p>

<p>The Shift</p>

<p>I live in Queens, New York, and I worked there during this time as well. During the day, the borough bustles with activity, especially on the busy street the mall I worked at was located. I would be getting ready for work at the same time everyone else was going to sleep for work the next day. While other people were tired, I was wide awake from the coffee I would have at around 10:00 PM at night.</p>

<p>Cities have a different character at night. When you’re walking the streets alone in the dark, you become aware of every sound. Every car passing, every siren blasting.</p>

<p>I remember walking down the streets of my neighborhood, trying to walk quickly to get to the bus stop so I wouldn’t have to wait an hour for the next bus. I remember for every person that passed me, I wondered if they were like me, working a job they hated that forced them to stay awake after hours.</p>

<p>I remember a feeling of paranoia that would sometimes come over me while I was on an empty bus. I couldn’t explain it, but I always felt like in the darkness, someone or something was watching me. I sometimes felt like the darkness itself was judging me. “Look what your life has come to.”</p>

<p>Then after getting to the store, I saw the last of the day time workers getting ready to leave. Sometimes they would have to stay, because the store was a mess and there were eighty stacks of jeans that needed to be folded properly. Before actually getting into my duties for the day, I would help them finish so they could leave before midnight.</p>

<p>And then my actual work began. If we got only fifty boxes of merchandise, it would be a light night. My shift ran from 11 PM to 7 AM most of the time, however I would rarely be leaving at 7. Most of the time, we would have to stay in order to complete all of our tasks. Those tasks were opening the boxes, folding the merchandise, censoring the merchandise, and finding somewhere to put the merchandise. Whether it was on the sales floor or in the stockroom.</p>

<p>Most of the time it would go to the stockroom. A cramped, fluorescent lit room filled with merchandise and marketing tools. It was the dustiest room I have ever seen. The first time I spent any amount of time there, I actually got sick. I still went to work the next night, because I needed the money. There were mouse traps in every corner, there were probably other vermin around as well. Mice and cockroaches are just as native to New York as New Yorkers are, after all.</p>

The shelves were extremely high up, filled to the brim with clothes. One night, all the clothes on one shelf fell because someone crashed into the shelf. Dozens of women’s shirts and sweaters were on the floor. I had to pick them up, fold them and put them back. When I asked for help, the person I asked looked like they wanted to quit right then and there.</p>

<p>The censoring was the worst part. They didn’t want us sitting down, because that would ‘slow us down’ in the words of management. I would be bent over, taking a little needle and putting it through the seam of a shirt or a pair of jeans. I lost count of the amount of times I’ve accidentally stabbed myself in my fingers. I never got blood on the clothes, but maybe someone else did.</p>

<p>Working in that stockroom taught me a valuable lesson. Whenever I buy clothes from anywhere, I will wash it before I wear it.</p>

When the shift finally ended, probably closer to 8 or 9 than 7, we would leave. And I would see the sun for the first time all day. It had a funny effect of making me more miserable, because I was so tired and hungry and just wanted to sleep, but the sun being high in the sky tricked my brain into wanting to stay awake.</p>

<p>And then I would go home, at around 9:30 AM, and fall asleep. I would wake up at around 4:30–5, and then do it all again.</p>

<p>The Effects</p>

<p>Human beings are not meant to be up at that hour, let alone actually staying up through the night. Our circadian rhythms naturally line up with the cycle of day of night. Staying up that late, through the night, even with four cups of black coffee, took a great deal of effort. Light-exposure basically keeps the body awake and alert, and as night time comes, our bodies get prepared for sleep.</p>

<p>When most people think of circadian rhythms, they probably think of their sleeping habits. However, circadian rhythms also affect a lot more than just sleeping patterns. Digestion is also affected by the circadian rhythm. Poor sleeping habits have been linked to gastrointestinal problems.</p>

As a personal anecdote, when I was on these night shifts, I was also in every other way obsessed with my health. I would exercise every day, meticulously track my calories, and track my progress across each workout. As I look back on those days, I barely made any progress in strength or conditioning. In fact, I even gained 15 lbs while I was on these shifts. It wasn’t 15 lbs of muscle either, despite what I told myself.</p>

<p>As another personal anecdote, on days when I did not work, I found it difficult to actually sleep. At night, when I wasn’t working, I fell asleep easily, but I did not stay asleep easily. Restless would be the best term to use for my sleeping habits.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization classified night shift work as a potential carcinogen. Proper sleeping habits are so important for health and quality of life.</p>

<p>After six months of these shifts, I asked to go back down to the morning/afternoon/anything-but-night shifts. I couldn’t take those night shifts anymore. Management agreed, and I never looked back.</p>
