    <p>Around this time last year, I was a graphic designer and video editor. And one thing I learned while working in that field and trying to find freelance or W2 work, was that there were a lot of fake job postings.</p>

<p>I would apply for a seemingly legitimate looking position. “Graphic Designer at X Marketing”, for example. A small company that I have never heard of, but they seem legitimate at a first glance. The qualifications/requirements weren’t ridiculous, the pay was good, it was a remote position, the job posting seemed like a dream come true. And then, a few days later, I would get an email from the company.</p>

<p>And every red flag went straight up.</p>

<p>The email would have poor grammar, the email address deliberately misspelled, an immediate job offer without an interview. Requiring that you click on a link in the email, requiring that you download some software through a link in the email, and a dozen more red flags that I can’t even remember.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until I did a cybersecurity bootcamp that I learned there was an actual term for this, and it is called ‘phishing.’</p>

<p>Phishing is a type of attack where a malicious actor attempts to gain personal information, usually by posing as someone else, or a legitimate organization, and contacting their targets through email. Emails that say something like “You Just Won $100,000!”, text messages that say “Your Netflix Account is on hold, please click here to verify your payment info.”</p>

<p>In the case of a fake job posting, the sensitive information they probably want is a social security number, since being employed by any company requires that information. They most likely want it for other identity theft schemes. Other sensitive information could be your passwords, credit card numbers, or even complete control over your computer. If the fake job posting is for an in-person job, however, the consequences can and probably will be more severe.</p>

<p>In my own experience looking for work as a designer, at some points it seemed like every other job posting was going to lead to a phishing scam. If I look through my email, I could probably find a dozen of them. It has been less severe in my search for a role in cybersecurity, but I do think there are still a few fake job postings I have accidentally applied for. I think there are a few reasons for these fake job postings.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of people who are job hunting are going to be looking for a long time. As of this writing, I have been looking for a job for at least two and a half months, and if you go on LinkedIn you’ll find plenty of posts from people who have been looking for a lot longer. That is a long time to be a target.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of people apply indiscriminately to job postings without actually reading the job requirements. I myself am guilty of this, but on sites like Indeed and LinkedIn, there are job postings where you can submit an application with just a click of a button. Pretty much every single fake job posting I’ve come across has been some variation of ‘easy apply’. For every fake job posting I’ve gotten a response for, when I actually looked at the posting carefully, I thought to myself “how could I think this was real?”</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>-This is just anecdotal, but when I’m job hunting for weeks and months on end without hearing any results, it is a strange euphoria when I actually do get a response. When that response is actually positive, it almost turns off any sense of danger that I might have.</p>

<p>Luckily I have never fallen for these schemes and I can usually spot them pretty easily. I have a mental list of things I look out for when I get a response I believe is for a fake company, or a fake posting.</p>

<p>Poor grammar — This is usually the first thing I notice when I’m reading their emails. Missing punctuation, misspelled words, using words incorrectly.</p>

<p>You can’t find the person on LinkedIn — The first thing I do when I receive an email regarding a job is to look the person up on LinkedIn.</p>

<p>Misspelled email address — sometimes I applied for companies that are actually real, and an attacker is pretending to be from that company. If that is the case, one of the biggest tells is to look at the email address. It is usually slightly misspelled. For example, @xdigitalmarketing as the legitimate email, @xdigtalmarketing as the phishing email.</p>

<p>Job offer without an interview — this one kind of goes without saying, but I did one time get a job offer (complete with salary and benefits!) after just applying to the posting. I don’t think it’s controversial to say that every employer is going to want to talk to a prospective employee before hiring them, no matter how amazing their resume may seem.</p>

<p>They want your social security number — if before even interviewing you, they are mentioning your social security number, run away.</p>

<p>They mention credit scores — I once got an email that mentioned my credit score needed to be above a certain number to work for their company.</p>

<p>None of these things, on their own, would be a huge cause for alarm, except for the last three. However, for fake job emails, I usually see a few of them together.</p>

<p>If you’re having trouble figuring out if a job posting is fake or not, in my experience if there is something about it that doesn’t look right, doing my research on the company will usually prove it to be real. Just personally speaking, if something looks too good to be true, it probably is too good to be true.</p>
